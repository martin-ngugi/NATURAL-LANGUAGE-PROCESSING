# Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Sentiment Analysis 

## Business Understanding

### Introduction

Harnessing the potential of sentiment analysis in the context of customer feedback on Twitter is a crucial move toward improving corporate expansion, making well-informed choices, and maximizing profitability. In this project, our goal is to thoroughly investigate the sentiment expressed by Twitter users in their feedback towards companies. We will achieve this by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to uncover the range of sentiments and their significant impact on businesses. Our data source for this project will be Dataworld.

### Main Objective

Develop a resilient model for sentiment analysis that assesses the sentiment of tweets by evaluating their content.

### Overview

This project's goal is to construct a multiclass sentiment analysis classifier for tweets. The primary aim is to assess and classify tweets into three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. This analysis provides the means for businesses and individuals to grasp public sentiment, track brand image, and make well-informed choices.

### Project Advantages

A. Enable businesses to make decisions based on data.

B. Improve marketing tactics by grasping customer sentiment.

C. Supervise and maintain brand reputation.

D. Stay updated on public viewpoints regarding different subjects and occurrences.

## Conclusion

In this project, we considered various models for sentiment analysis of text data. We started with a basic model that uses neural networks (NNs) to store sequence information in text data.
We then experimented with more advanced models such as LSTM and tuned bidirectional LSTM to check if there is improvement of accuracy. Based on the accuracy results obtained above, the LSTM Model has an accuracy of 0.6599 which is the best of all.

## Recommendation

To better enhance the model performance, we should consider exploring a model like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT), for sentiment analysis. The BERT models should have greater impact in NLP tasks which would or may result to even more better and accurate sentiment analysis results.
